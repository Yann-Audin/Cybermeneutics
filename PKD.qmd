The *Philip K. Dick Cybermeneutics Project* is a case study for my thesis. It is an attempt at computer-assisted hermeneutics in which I combine close reading and distant reading methods to analyse Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories with classical and algorithmic techniques. 

The project was presented during the [2025 CSDH Conference](presentations/CSDH2025/Cybermeneutics/cybermeneutics_v01.qmd).
