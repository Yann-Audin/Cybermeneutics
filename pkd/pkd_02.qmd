## The Dickian question

The question at the core of [Philip K. Dick](pkd_01)'s project is the same one that lead me to study physics at the graduate level, and the same one that still animates me in my literary studies to this day: "What is reality?"

> Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.
> -- Philip K. Dick, *I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon* [-@dick_hope_TODO]

Reality isn't something that is easy to understand; it seems that any one approach to try to grasp at it is a form of epistemic violence towards the universe itself, and a combination of approach inevariably leads to the need for incompatible points of view to exist simultaneously. Paul Valéry wrote "Nous ne raisonnons que par modèles" ["We only think through models", my translation], but systems are never complete, they do not hold to scrutiny like we hope something like a universe should/would. What if the (human) universe is, like language and mathematics, a system created by the network of affordances and perceptual horizons humans inherited from the laws of physics, language and culture? Studying the universe might lead to the same dead ends described by Gödel in his Incompleteness theorems: mathematical systems cannot justify themselves. On one hand, there is 

Munchausen's trilemna

Anyway, how does one take hold of the system of which they are a part of? This reformulation of the question can be applied to mathematics, physics and language alike: the pretension of objectivity fails systematically, is the unobserved universe worth creating?

Frank Herbert also touches on the Dickian question, although he comes at it from a spiritual (and less neurotic) avenue:

> She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: "A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it."
> -- Frank Herbert, *Dune* [-@herbert_dune_1965]

Dick does not see the mystery of life as a flow in which one can let themselves go, he knows enough to know the shape of the prison, and presents his view of breaking out in *Valis*:

> To fight the Empire is to be infected by its derangement ... Whoever defeats the Empire becomes the Empire; it proliferates like a virus ... thereby it becomes its enemies. 
> -- Philip K. Dick, *Valis* [-@dick_valis_TODO]

### No one is prophet in their own (time or) country

My views on Philip K. Dick are tainted by regret: on one hand, if he had been born at any other time or place, he might have been taken seriously; he might have been the philosopher his time as well as our time needed. On the other hand, if he had been born at any other time or place, he wouldn't be Philip K. Dick. His work was confined to science-fiction by material and cultural forces beyond his control -- he only manage to have one of his non-scifi novel published -- keeping his idea in stasis, away from serious criticism. 

> The fact that what Dick is entertaining us about is reality and madness,time and death, sin and salvation -- this has escaped most readers and critics. Nobody notices; nobody notices that we have our own homegrown Borges, and have had him for 30 years
> -- Ursula K. Leguin, "Science Fiction as Prophesy" [-@leguin_science_1976]^[The original article from *The New Repulbic* vol. 175 is not readily available online, so this quote was retrieved from "Edmundo Paz Soldán and his Precursors: Borges, Dick, and the SF Canon" [@soldan_edmundo_2007]. ]

As for any other speculative fiction writer, some of Philip K. Dick's prediction came to pass, others are well on their way, and others are still the subject of more science-fiction than actual science. His insight on communication technologies and the consequences of handing so much information and power to a small number of telecommunication corporations [@dick_TODO] seems evident to the modern audience. In *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*, his description of *Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends* -- a 24/7 news and variety show starring a never aging, never tiring cast that is later revealed to be fully automated -- warns us of parasocial relationships, infinite scrolling, deepfakes and AI generated content. 



## Why you should read Philip K. Dick

To know Philip K. Dick's work is to recognize Dickianism everywhere. When the nature of reality is contested in contemporary media, one can usually draw a line to Dick, either directly -- *Bladerunner*, *The Adjustment Bureau*, *Total Recall*, *Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams*, *Minority Report*, ... -- or indirectly -- *The Matrix*, *Donnie Darko*, *The Truman Show*, *Westworld*, ...

This is not to say that Philip K. Dick changed much of the culture around him. In many ways, he was more a slave to the pressure of his time than many other authors who set themselves outside of the world as an observer, and he did not become a literary recluse. Dick was first and foremost an American white man who grew up and lived in an era of extraordinary and frightening technological and cultural transformations, and who became the nexus for the overwhelming forces of his time.
