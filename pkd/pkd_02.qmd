## Why we should read Philip K. Dick's fiction

To know Philip K. Dick's work is to recognize him everywhere. When the nature of reality is contested in contemporary media, one can usually draw a line to Dick, either directly -- *Bladerunner*, *The Adjustment Bureau*, *Total Recall*, *Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams*, *Minority Report*, ... -- or indirectly -- *The Matrix*, *Donnie Darko*, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, *The Truman Show*, *Westworld*, ... It is easy to trace many ideas in today's *zeitgeist* to his work, despite the narrowness of science-fiction readership. As an author, Dick didn't set himself or his writing apart from the world: he wasn't a literary recluse, didn't prop himself as an observer of society, didn't attempt to create a universal work of art, and the boundary between his personal life, his activism and his art was flimsy at best. Rather, he acted as a canary in a coal mine: Dick was first and foremost an American white man who grew up and lived in an era of extraordinary and frightening technological and cultural transformations, and who became a creative nexus for the formidable and overwhelming forces of his time. 

The pressures of the World Wars and the Cold Wars, the blooming of psychology, the rediscovery of ancient Christian texts, post-war interests in psychoanalysis and esoterism, California's drug culture, military experiemnts with LSD, the rise of no-fault divorce in the US, the boom of pulp sci-fi, the blind enthousiasm of futurism, the post-truth mediatic turn, quantum mechanics and cosmology, the space race, the first serious talks of artificial intelligence and androids, the Bomb and its aftermath... Philip K. Dick lived and captured all of it and more. He transformed the falseness and the brokeness of a life that is both extremely specific---being an American in the 50s, 60s and 70s---and completely generalisable---living with crushing doubt and through sweeping changes---into literary truth.

## **If nothing I say could convince you to read science-fiction:**

I am well aware that if you think that S-F cannot hold literary value, it's unlikely that I could convince you to read Philip K. Dick if I were to describe it as "science-fiction, but even weirder". Instead, here is my half-baked appeal to canonicity on why you might want to try to read some S-F and Dick's work:

- In most "best books of all time" lists, science-fiction tends to take 4--5% of the spots[^lists] despite being a relatively young and marginal genre;
- Philip K. Dick was the first science-fiction author to be included in The Library of America series;
- More than 26 000 scholarly articles mention him, and his work inspired Jean Baudrillard's very canonical *Simulacres et simulation*[^baudrillard];
- Dick's extensive body of work is still being adapted to television and cinema (sometimes directly, often indirectly), and he has had a lasting impact on multiple genre beyond science-fiction and speculative fiction.

However if the tropes of science-fiction are enough to make you put down a book, I don't actually believe that you actually *should* read Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories. That being said...

## Why we should also read Philip K. Dick's non-fiction

Philip K. Dick's non-fiction is a strange land few seem willing to explore, and with good reasons. On one hand, it is extremely varied and on the other it is extremely voluminous: between the essays, speeches, letters, notes, journal entries and poems he either published or kept in his files, there are more than ten thousand pages. His *Exegesis*, a living document he started in 1974 and never finished, is estimated at more than two millions words [@dick_letters1974]---of which only a fraction were published---, and the *selected* letters, released to the public after his death, fill six volumes[^PKD_letters]. These texts reveal the complexity of a broken, yet 

In "Dark Haired Girls"---a collation of letters, notes on dreams and non-fiction that he unsuccessfully tried to publish in 1972, 1974 and 1977, but was published posthumously by his in 1988---Paul Williams, the executor to his literary estate, writes in the introduction:

[^PKD_letters]:Dick started to produce carbon copies of his letters starting as early as 1964, although many were lost to an alleged burglary in 1971, and then when he left Marin County in early 1972 [@dick_letters1974]. It is more precise to say that: it is more precise to say that most of his correspondance post 1972 still exists in the numerous boxes of documents he left behind. 

> I wish I could trust you, friend, but in the face of Phil's persuasiveness, I am not sure I can, so instead I'm going to tell you flat out:
>
> This is a tale told by an unreliable narrator, who recognizes his own unreliability and yet at the same time believes everything he says. If you in turn allow yourself to believe uncritically everything he says, you are a damn fool. Watch out. Especially if you think you are not a damn fool, watch out. [@dick_dark_TODO]





> I got a letter from a fellow science fiction writer who had reviewed VALIS, favorably... he mentioned that he had himself done a novel based on Gnosticism, and I wrote him raising several issues basic to Gnosticism, whereupon he wrote back to say that he considered such matters essentially "futile game," and, what was more, dangerous to play around with. "I have a family to support," he wrote. "I don't dare think about such things" (I'm paraphrasing, but that is the gist of it). What a dreadful thing: that someone would consider ideas too dangerous to think about, [he] even went so far to suggest that it was very possible that you could become crazy due to wondering about fundamental epistemological, philosophical questions. Good lord; have we come to that?
> 
>  An intellectual dark age seems to be settling over the United States. People are literally frightened by new ideas. [...] I suppose there is a risk. There has *always* been a risk. But is not this risk a grand risk, the sign of a noble heart? The intellectual pioneers of our species ventured forth in the contemplation and analysis of "dangerous" ideasl; this is how we have come to acquire a vast heritage of knowledge and wisdom. And yet---people are afraid. The question I put to this writer is, "Does the universe in fact exist, or are we compelled by some mysterious agency to take it ineluctably for real? That is, we are compelled against our choice---even our knowledge---to take it to be real." [@dick_selected1981-1982]


> But the state of things is so dreary here in the U.S.— they say the elderly and poor are eating canned dogfood, now, to stay alive, and the McDonald hamburg­ers are made from cows’ eyes. The radio also says that today when Charles Colson, the President’s former counsel, went into jail he still wore his Richard M. Nixon tieclasp. “California dreaming is becoming a reality,” is a line from a Mamas & The Papas song of a few years ago, but what a dreadful surreal reality it is: foglike and dangerous, with the subtle and terrible manifestations of evil rising up like rocks in the gloom. I wish I was somewhere else. Disneyland, maybe. The last sane place here? Forever to take Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride and never get off? [@dick_letters3_1974]




> So I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudorealities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms. I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it. And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing.
