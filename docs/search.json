    "text": "The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick\n\nSeveral times I’ve had the uncanny experience of meeting people who resemble persons, characters, I’d previously made up for my novels. In Flow My Tears there’s a 19 year old girl named Kathy, as you recall, whom Jason meets; she is a girl of the gutter, so to speak, living a quasi-illegal existence. The next year, 1971, I in fact did meet a girl, the same age, living a life so similar to that of the girl in the novel as to frighten me—frighten me that if she reads the book ever she may sue. Her name—Kathy. (Dick 2011)"

The editor was Don Wollheim, who later on (1954) bought my first novel … and many since” (Sutin 2005). He worked for a radio station and then a record store during high school, a job he kept during and after he attempted college in 1949.

    "text": "2 Addicts, under the face of God\nDrugs and abuse were a major theme in Philip K. Dick’s life and oeuvre, his novel A Scanner Darkly is at least partially autobiographical and features drug houses, psychotic episodes and withdrawal (A. R. Dick 1995). To sustain himself and his families (Dick was married five times – May to November of 1948, 1950 to 1959, 1959 to 1965, 1966 to 1972, and 1973 to 1977 – and had three children), Dick used and abused drugs, mainly amphetamines, cannabis and antidepressants to alternatively bolster his writing and calm his anxiety (Sutin 2005). California in the 60s and 70s had a prominent drug culture which let Dick experiment with different substances. According to his third wife, Anne R. Dick:\n\nRay Nelson brought some [LSD] for Phil to take. The two of them sat together in Phil’s house for eight hours while Phil had a terrible hallucination, sweating, feeling completely alone, reexperiencing a spear thrust through his body, and speaking Latin, as he re-lived a life as a Roman gladiator. (A. R. Dick 1995)\n\nThis was the first and last time that Dick used LSD2, but visions of the Roman empire and of early Christians would become prevalent in his life. One such vision led him to convert to Anglicanism in 1964 (A. R. Dick 1995; Davis 2019) :\n\nI looked up in the sky and saw a face[,] a vast visage of perfect evil […]. It had empty slots for eyes – it was metal and cruel and, worst of all, it was God. (P. K. Dick 2002)\n\nDick would later explain the vision as the result of an 8-hour writing session that acted as a form of sensory deprivation, but his conversion and his subsequent interest towards theology – Christian, Gnostic, Jewish, etc. – marked his writing and the way he experienced the world. Experiences such as this one contributed to his reputation as a drug user, but according to Nancy Hackett, his fourth wife and mother of his second daughter Isa:\n\nWhen Philip was married to me, he never wrote except when he needed money. Then he would write a novel in six days by using amphetamines. (A. R. Dick 1995)\n\nIn 1971, after a series of incidents including a burglary, Dick lost his house to the drug users he had let in (P. K. Dick 1988). That year, he left for Canada where he attempted suicide by overdose of potassium bromide after being rejected by a woman he fell in love with in Vancouver (A. R. Dick 1995). Dick’s relation to drugs changed after this event and he engaged in outreach with rehabilitation and prevention organisations (P. K. Dick 2011).\n\n\n\nA letter sent to the Orange County Drug Information Service in October of 1972."

    "text": "3 “2-3-74”\n\nThe doorbell rang and I went, and there stood this girl with black, black hair and large eyes very lovely and intense; I stood staring at her, amazed, also confused, thinking I’d never seen such a beautiful girl, and why was she standing there? She handed me the package of medication [Darvon], and I tried to think what to say to her; I noticed, then, a fascinating gold necklace around her neck and I said, “What is that? It certainly is beautiful,” just, you see, to find something to say to hold her there. The girl indicated the major figure in it, which was a fish. “This is a sign used by the early Christians,” she said, and then departed. (Sutin 2005)\n\nDick’s most important drug fueled vision would come to him in February of 1974 (P. K. Dick 2011), after four years of writer’s block (Butler 2000). He was then married to Leslie Busby, a young woman who also acted as his secretary and went by the name of Tessa, with whom Dick had a son, Christopher. Dick and Tessa had, according to multiple accounts, a fusional relationship, although they were fighting on multiple trivial issues such as cleaning and cooking3 (A. R. Dick 1995; Sutin 2005). In February of 1974, while recovering from an impacted wisdom tooth extraction, and still under the influence of sodium pentothal, Philip K. Dick received a delivery from a woman wearing a gold pendant with an ichthus, an early Christian symbol. The sight of light reflecting off the ichthus triggered something in him: he experienced a pink beam of light transmitting information directly into his brain (P. K. Dick 2011). The experience overwhelmed Dick who found himself superposed between his own reality and the absolute conviction that the whole universe was stuck in 50 AC. In this world, the “Empire never ended” (P. K. Dick 1981b) and Philip K. Dick was, in reality, Thomas, an early Christian persecuted by Rome.\n\nBut the core of the difficult truths that Phil held dear in his last years lay in 2-3-74. No one can pass upon the unanswerable question: Were those events real? Phil himself had no doubt that something had happened, though he always retained as a possibility–as his friend and fellow SF writer K. W. Deter observes–the “minimum hypothesis” that they were self-delusion. (Sutin 2005)\n\nIn February and March of that year, Dick continued to experience visions which he attempted to describe, understand and analyse in journals that would, in the end, amount to more than 8000 pages, some manuscript and others typed on his typewriter (Itzkoff 2010). These visions shaped and informed Dick’s writing; his last novels Radio Free Albemuth, VALIS, The Divine Invasion and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer all focus on his religious experience and the pink beam of light.\n\nA beam of pink light blinded him; he felt dreadful pain in his head, and clapped his hands to his eyes. I am blind! he realized. With the pain and the pink light came understanding, an acute knowledge; he knew that Zina was not a human woman, and he knew, further, that the boy Manny was not a human boy. This was not a real world he was in; he understood that because the beam of pink light had told him that. This world was a simulation, and something living and intelligent and sympathetic wanted him to know. (P. K. Dick 1981a)\n\n\nThe cardinal point which Fat had made to us regarding his experience with the pink beam which had injured and blinded him was this: he claimed that instantly – as soon as the beam struck him – he knew things he had never known. (P. K. Dick 1981b)\n\nIn VALIS, the pink beam reveals to the main character – Horselover Fat, a stand-in for Philip K. Dick himself – that his son has a dangerous, but easily treatable heart defect. The same thing happened to Dick who had his son Christopher tested for a potentially fatal inguinal hernia after one of his visions. The results of the tests were positive, and a surgery fixed Christopher’s heart (P. K. Dick 2011; Sutin 2005). The blurring of reality and fiction, divinity and decay, creation and entropy were central to Dick’s life and work: in his Exegesis and in discussions, he mentions writing “reports” rather than novels (Carrère 2004). Paul Williams, Dick’s literary executor and the editor for The Dark-Haired Girl, warns readers:\n\nThis is a tale told by an unreliable narrator, who recognizes his own unreliability and yet at the same time believes everything he says. If you in turn allow yourself to believe uncritically everything he says, you are a damn fool. Watch out. Especially if you think you are not a damn fool, watch out. (P. K. Dick 1988)"

    "section": "4 I am alive and you are dead",
    "text": "4 I am alive and you are dead\nEmmanuel Carrère’s biography of Philip K. Dick, Je suis vivant et vous êtes mort, refers to Ubik in which Glen Runciter leads a team of “inertials” – people with the ability to negate psychic powers – to secure a Moon base from telepaths. After an explosion that claims the life of Runciter, Joe Chip, the mission technician, takes command of the team to rush their boss back on Earth to allow him to exist in artificial half-life. Joe and the other inertials are surprised to see signs of an entity trying to help them by any mean necessary as time and space begins to crumble around them. From his half-life pod, Runciter is silent, but still, it seems that he tries to using other means such as a message on the walls of the men’s bathroom:\n\n“Jump in the urinal and stand on your head\nI’m the one that’s alive. You’re all dead.\nLean over the bowl and then take a dive\nAll of you are dead. I am alive.” (P. K. Dick 1969)\n\nIn the real world, Runciter is desperately trying to save his team and make them understand that they are, in fact, the ones who died on the Moon and are now suspended in half-life. As more and more of Joe Chip’s team succumb to the time anomalies, it becomes very difficult to ignore the hints that the world he inhabits is not real. On one hand, signs of Runciter’s interventions are everywhere, and on the other, Jory, another half-lifer with the power to consume consciousness to sustain himself tries to kill Joe. Joe is saved by a collective of half-lifers, who developed a way to repel Jory, and Runciter mourns the loss of his team. But the novel ends with Glen Runciter, alive and inhabiting the real world, finding the face of Joe Chip on the coins in his pocket, as if Joe was trying to communicate with him: as if Runciter was himself in a half-life fictitious world.\nIn February and March of 1982, a series of strokes left Philip K. Dick brain dead at the age of 53. He was disconnected from life support on March 2nd, eight years and ten days after the events of 2-3-74.\nIn this reality, we are alive and he is dead."

    "text": "1 The Dickian question\nThe question at the core of Philip K. Dick’s project is the same one that lead me to study physics at the graduate level, and the same one that still animates me in my literary studies to this day: “What is reality?”\n\nReality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away. – Philip K. Dick, I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon [-@dick_hope_TODO]\n\nReality isn’t something that is easy to understand; it seems that any approach to try to grasp at it is a form of violence towards the universe. How does one take hold of the system of which they are a part of? This reformulation of the question can be applied to mathematics and language, which brings us to a problem: these systems are not complete, they do not hold to scrutiny like we hope something like the universe would. What if the universe is, like language and mathematics, a system created by the network of affordances and perceptual horizons humans inherited from the laws of physics, language and culture? Studying the universe might lead to the same dead ends described by Gödel in his Incompleteness theorems; maybe the only solutions are infinite regression (nihilism), cyclical explanations (absurdism) or axiomatism (faith). Frank Herbert also touches on the Dickian question, although he comes at it from a spiritual (and less neurotic) avenue:\n\nShe said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: “A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.” – Frank Herbert, Dune [-@herbert_dune_1965]\n\nDick does not see the mystery of life as a flow in which one can let themselves go, he knows enough to know the shape of the prison, and presents his view of breaking out in Valis:\n\nTo fight the Empire is to be infected by its derangement … Whoever defeats the Empire becomes the Empire; it proliferates like a virus … thereby it becomes its enemies. – Philip K. Dick, Valis [-@dick_valis_TODO]\n\n\n1.1 No one is prophet in their own (time or) country\nMy views on Philip K. Dick are tainted by regret: on one hand, if he had been born at any other time or place, he might have been taken seriously; he might have been the philosopher his time as well as our time needed. On the other hand, if he had been born at any other time or place, he wouldn’t be Philip K. Dick. His work was confined to science-fiction by material and cultural forces beyond his control – he only manage to have one of his non-scifi novel published – keeping his idea in stasis, away from serious criticism.\n\nThe fact that what Dick is entertaining us about is reality and madness,time and death, sin and salvation – this has escaped most readers and critics. Nobody notices; nobody notices that we have our own homegrown Borges, and have had him for 30 years – Ursula K. Leguin, “Science Fiction as Prophesy” [-@leguin_science_1976]1\n\nAs for any other speculative fiction writer, some of Philip K. Dick’s prediction came to pass, others are well on their way, and others are still the subject of more science-fiction than actual science. His insight on communication technologies and the consequences of handing so much information and power to a small number of telecommunication corporations [@dick_TODO] seems evident to the modern audience. In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, his description of Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends – a 24/7 news and variety show starring a never aging, never tiring cast that is later revealed to be fully automated – warns us of parasocial relationships, infinite scrolling, deepfakes and AI generated content."

Dick was first and foremost an American white man who grew up and lived in an era of extraordinary and frightening technological and cultural transformations, and who became a creative nexus for the formidable and overwhelming forces of his time.\nThe pressures of the World Wars and the Cold Wars, the blooming of psychology, the rediscovery of ancient Christian texts, post-war interests in psychoanalysis and esoterism, California’s drug culture, military experiemnts with LSD, the rise of no-fault divorce in the US, the boom of pulp sci-fi, the blind enthousiasm of futurism, the post-truth mediatic turn, quantum mechanics and cosmology, the space race, the first serious talks of artificial intelligence and androids, the Bomb and its aftermath… Philip K. Dick lived and captured all of it and more. He transformed the falseness and the brokeness of a life that is both extremely specific – being an American in the 50s, 60s and 70s – and completely generalisable – living with crushing doubt and through sweeping changes – into literary truth, published in the silliest of genre: science-fiction.\nThat being said, one must also make a case to study Philip K.

Beyond formal systems, Münchhausen’s trilemna make a similar case for knowledge\nFries’ Trilemna tries to address this limit by reframing the problem: things can be known dogmatically, through infinite regresses, or by basing oneself on perceptual experience.

Another part of it is my fascination with the literary character that is Philip K. Dick and the improbable life he lead as well as the impact he still has on us to this day. But then again, that does not explain why I should write about him today, because the real reason is deeper and, I am afraid, more sinister. Like Albert Camus, Margaret Atwood, Samuel Beckett, and other literary philosophers, Philip K. Dick doesn’t simply write. He is not bound by aesthetic or storytelling, is main thesis is not political5, nor is it aspirational. No, Philip K. Dick has a philosophy about the nature of reality that encompasses many of the troubles, both social and political, of our current age.\n\nSo I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudorealities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms. I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it. And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing.\nPhilip K. Dick, How To Build A Universe That Doesn’t Fall Apart Two Days Later (1978)\n\nMoreover, the genre of science-fiction allowed him to adress issues that did not even exist during his time that are not central to our current era.\nThe fact that PKD presented his work as a reflexion on the nature of reality and mankind warrants greater academic attention, which this blog will hopefully contribute to6. But the main and central reason why I personally decided to write about Philip K. Dick is that I was, long ago, infected by his ideas.\n\nIs there anyone there\nWho understands me?\nAnyone at all?\n[…]\nI have to know what is real\nAnd what is illusion\nOh, how does it feel\nBeyond this confusion?\n\n– “Monkeyland”, The Chameleons UK (1983)"
