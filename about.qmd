I am a PhD candidate at the University of Montreal and my research interests are Digital Humanities, Literature and Epistemology. I am affiliated, through my supervisors Marcello Vitali-Rosati and Dominic Forest, to the [Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques](crihn.org), and to the [Canadian Society for Digital Humanities](https://csdh-schn.org/) as a graduate representative.
